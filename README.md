#Gradio App for Generating and Validating Ecore Files
This repository contains a Gradio-based web application that leverages open-source language models from HuggingChat API and OpenAI API. The app provides two tabs: one for using models from HuggingChat and the other for models from OpenAI. Both tabs allow users to generate an Ecore file from a natural language description and iteratively validate it.

##Features
*Two Tabs for Model Selection:
  * HuggingChat API: Uses open-source language models from HuggingChat.
  * OpenAI API: Uses language models from OpenAI.
*Ecore File Generation: Converts natural language descriptions into Ecore files.
*Iterative Validation: Validates the generated Ecore files iteratively to ensure correctness.
