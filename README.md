# Gradio App for Ecore generation and iterative validation using LLMs
This repository contains a Gradio-based web application that leverages open-source language models from HuggingChat API and OpenAI API. The app provides three tabs: one for using models from HuggingChat and the other for models from OpenAI and the last to check to generated files and download them. Both tabs allow users to generate an Ecore file from a natural language description and iteratively validate it.

## Features
- Two Tabs for Model Selection:
	- HuggingChat API: Uses open-source language models from HuggingChat.
	- OpenAI API: Uses language models from OpenAI.
- A Tab for checking the generated Ecore files and downloading them
- Ecore File Generation: Converts natural language descriptions into Ecore files.
- Iterative Validation: The generated Ecore files are either syntactically correct or contain an error that could not be fixed and needs human intervention.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlaouiMdaghriAhmed/Ecore-Gen.git
cd ecore-gen
```

## Tool Reference
The project heavily relied on pyecore : https://github.com/pyecore/pyecore .

We also used the hugchat api : https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api .

## Gradio app on HuggingFace Spaces:
The deployed gradio app doesn't contain the huggingchat tab as the api returned some error while being setup in the spaces.
